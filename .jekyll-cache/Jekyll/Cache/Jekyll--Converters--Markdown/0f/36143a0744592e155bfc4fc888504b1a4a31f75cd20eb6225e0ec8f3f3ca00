I"<p>Drones are aerial robots that have gained popularity in recent years. They were born in the military field and with the lowering of their costs have opened up possibilities for commercial use in several civil applications such as infrastructure monitoring, agriculture, surveillance, event recording, etc.. They are robots and so they are composed of sensors, actuators and processors on the hardware side. Its intelligence, however, lies on its software.</p>

<p>The Program-A-Robot competition aims at engineering students, grad, master or PhD students, all over the world and its goal is to foster robotics and computer vision providing nice challenges and an opportunity to measure your solution with other fellow competitors. It was born in 2016 as a robotic competition inside Rey Juan Carlos University (2016, Spanish). The second edition (2017,Spanish) was organized inside the Spanish Jornadas Nacionales de Rob√≥tica. This year the third edition will be held as part of the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2018). It will take place in Madrid in October, 1-5 2018.</p>
