<p><a href="https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/">RoboticsAcademy</a> is an <strong>open source</strong> collection of exercises to learn robotics in a practical way. Gazebo simulator is the main tool required, as ROS. The students program their solutions in <strong>Python language</strong>. Each exercise is composed of :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Gazebo configuration files,</li>
  <li>A ROS node that hosts the studentâ€™s code,</li>
  <li>A file with instructions, hints, etc..</li>
  <li>The student solution itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>1, 2, and 3 are already provided, the student has to develop her code on a separate file which already has a <strong>template</strong>. The student may use there an existing simple Python API to access to sensor readings and actuator <code class="highlighter-rouge">commands_</code> (HAL API) and she may use an existing simple Python API for Graphical User Interface and <code class="highlighter-rouge">debugging_</code> (GUI API). To develop her solution the student has to edit that template file and add her code, using her favorite text editor.</p>
