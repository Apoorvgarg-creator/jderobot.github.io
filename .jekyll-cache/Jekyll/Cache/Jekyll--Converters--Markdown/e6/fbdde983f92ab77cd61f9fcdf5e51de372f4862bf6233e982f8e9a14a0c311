<p>DetectionSuite is a C++ on-development tool to test and train different <strong>DeepLearning architectures for object detection</strong> on images. It accepts several known international datasets like PASCALVOC and allows the comparison of several DeepLearning architectures over exactly the same test data. It computes several objective statistics and measures their performance. Currently it support YOLO architectures on Darknet framework.</p>
