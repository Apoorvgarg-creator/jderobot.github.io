**The Google Summer of Code** (GSoC), is an international annual program, first held from May to August 2005, in which Google awards stipends, which depends on the purchasing power parity of the country the student's university belongs to, to all students who successfully complete a requested free and open-source software coding project during the summer. The program is open to university students aged 18 or over. (source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code)).



**JdeRobot** has been represented on **4 occasions** where students from many **parts of the world** have collaborated in software development. Take a look at the projects presented and the students involved.
