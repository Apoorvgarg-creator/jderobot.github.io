JdeRobot is a software toolkit for developing robotics and computer vision applications. These domains include sensors (for instance, cameras), actuators, and intelligent software in between. It is mostly written in C++, Python and JavaScript languages and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the application program is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. They may run in different computers and are connected using ICE communication middleware or ROS messages. Components interoperate through explicit interfaces. Each one may have its own independent Graphical User Interface or none at all. It is ROS-friendly and full compatible with ROS-Melodic (and Gazebo9)

# Ideas list

JdeRobot simplifies the access to hardware devices from the control program. Getting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function. The platform attaches those calls to the remote invocation on the components connected to the sensor or the actuator devices. They can be connected to real sensors and actuators or simulated ones, both locally or remotely using the network. Those functions build the API for the Hardware Abstraction Layer. The robotic application get the sensor readings and order the actuator commands using it to unfold its behavior. Several driver components have been developed to support different physical sensors, actuators and simulators. The drivers are used as components installed at will depending on your configuration. They are included in the official release.

This open source project needs further development in these topics:  --Work in Progress-- 

## Project #1: Robotics Academy: new computer vision exercises

**Brief Explanation**: JdeRobot’s [Robotics-Academy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy) is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It  consists of a collection of robot programming exercises using Python language where the student has to code the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision. 

This framework is mainly ROS-based and openCV-based, but there [several exercises on drones](https://wiki.jderobot.org/Robotics-Academy#Exercises_on_drones) from previous releases of Robotics Academy which still run with non-ROS infrastructure. The main idea of this project is to revisit seven available exercises on drone programming and replace the existing infrastructure (ad-hoc drivers, plugin and ICE communication) with full ROS infrastructure using PX4 navigation stack in Gazebo and mavROS. In this project you will learn mavROS basics, drone programming and interfacing robots with ROS. With this MavROS design (MavLink and ROS) the drone applications can be easily migrated from simulator to real drones. 

In addition the exercises will be also integrated in the Jupyter framework, so they can be run from the web release of Robotics Academy framework.

Examples of drone exercises:

## Project #2: Robotics Academy: multirobot version of the Amazon warehouse exercise in ROS2

**Brief Explanation**: JdeRobot’s [Robotics-Academy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy) is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises using Python language where the student has to code the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision. 


{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId1 %}


This framework is mainly ROS-based and openCV-based, but there several [exercises on autonomous vehicles](https://wiki.jderobot.org/Robotics-Academy#Exercises_on_autonomous_cars) and [on mobile robots](https://wiki.jderobot.org/Robotics-Academy#Exercises_on_mobile_robots) from previous releases of Robotics Academy which still run with non-ROS infrastructure. The goal of this project is to build a multirobot navigation exercise extending the already existing Amazon warehouse exercise to a fleet of robots and migrating its infrastructure to ROS2. ROS2 Navigation2 stack is pretty much developed for multiple robots. We could work on developing new exercises with ros2 for multi robots (2 for beginning). It will involve collision avoidance between robots, global path planning and Multi-robot coordination.

- **Expected results:** A new multirobot exercise in JdeRobot-Academy
- **Knowledge Prerequisite:** C++, Python programming skills, experience with ROS.
- **Good to know:*** ROS2
- **Mentors:** Pankhuri Vanjani (16uec069 AT lnmiit.ac.in) and David Pascual (d.pascualhe AT gmail.com). 

## Project #3: Robotics-Academy: Robotic arm manipulation with moveit!

**Brief Explanation**: JdeRobot’s [Robotics-Academy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy) is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises using Python language where the student has to code the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision. It is ROS and Gazebo based. 

The idea for this project is to introduce the robotic arms into Robotics-Academy developing exercises with robotic arms and the library moveit!. For a first approach we'll developing the classic [pick and place](http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/pick_place/pick_place_tutorial.html) exercise with python and gazebo. Once we reached the first approach, we'll continue increasing the complexity of algorithms and environments. There are similar works in [ARIAC competition](http://gazebosim.org/ariac), [udacity](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project), [here](https://github.com/fjnunes/RoboND-Kinematics-Project) and on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3gGQV-yjX0). Preliminar developments can also be found in the Final Degree thesis of [Ignacio Malo](https://wiki.jderobot.org/Imalo-tfg).

## Project #4: Robotics-Academy: exercises on Evolutionary Robotics

**Brief Explanation**: JdeRobot’s [Robotics-Academy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy) is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises using Python language where the student has to code the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision. It is ROS and Gazebo based.

The idea for this project is to introduce Evolutionary Robotics into Robotics-Academy developing exercises with mobile robots.  At the base level, we will be implementing static (e.g. MLP) and time dependent neural networks (e.g. CTRNN). Moreover, basic genetic algorithms should be implemented for its usage in Robotics-Academy; at least, simple selection, crossover, mutation and elites will be included in the development. At the user level, we will be implementing an API which allows the generation of the neural network morphology, connections and weight, thresholds and gains boundaries. Input networks should be connected to sensors and output networks to the actuators; its definition will also be in the API.

## Project #5: Improving VisualStates tool with ROS2 support and web-based GUI

**Brief Explanation**:  [VisualStates](https://jderobot.github.io/VisualStates) is a tool for programming robot behaviors using automata. It combines a graphical language to specify the states and the transitions with a text language (Python or C++). It generates a ROS node which implements the automata and shows a GUI at the runtime with the active state, for debugging. There is always a root state, if a user creates a single level automata behavior, the states defining the behavior are added as children to the root state. Every automata is also a state. Therefore, every automata can be added as a child to any other state. That way, the user is able to compose reactive behavior hierarchies.

The tool provides import functionality, when the user imports an already created automata, the whole one is copied into the current automata. Each hierarchy of behavior contains local namespace for its specific auxiliary code and the overall behavior can access the global namespace which contains the ROS related data and globally accessible auxiliary data.

In the scope of the project, following improvements are targeted:

* **ROS 2 support**:  ROS 2 is a complete rewrite of the original ROS robotic middleware, and addresses some major bottlenecks in ROS 1 leading to a major architecture change. As these versions aren't directly compatible, in order to benefit from these improvements the option of generating ROS 2 nodes instead is desirable.

* **Web-based GUI**: Currently the GUI used by the tool is Qt-based and, while Qt allows cross-system compatibility as there is support in multiple systems for this library, new Web-based technologies simplifies this task and adds other future desirable aspects of the GUI. We would like to study and reimplement the GUI in one of these web-based technologies.

## Project #6: Improving PyOnBrowser (running Python code on the web browser): support more Python features

**Brief Explanation**: WebSim is a web-based robot simulator. It is used for learning robot programming. It is based on AFRAME 3D VR framework in the web and provides a JavaScript API so the robot intelligence can be programmed in JavaScript, maybe from a web page. For instance it has been tested with 2 code editors, ACE Editor (for programming robot intelligence with JavaScript) and Blockly editor (for programming robot intelligence with visual Blockly language). Now we are working on allowing the programming of the robot intelligence directly in Python, also directly from the browser.

We have developed infrastructure to run Python on real Arduino based robots. Our plan is to be able to run the same programs in the standalone WebSim simulator. This requires transpiling the Python programs to Javascript (or compiling to WebAssembly). There are already transpilers and compilers from Python to Javascript or WebAssembly, so the first step would be to evaluate their maturity (Skulpt, Brython, Transcrypt, RapydScript). They could be integrated and used inside the browser directly. Then a shim for the robotics API should be developed, probably, the same one used for C++ in Arduino, testing the integration with the JavaScript libraries.

A different approach might be writing a simple transpiler for a subset of Python using the AST library and transpiling it using one of the available transpilers. This would let us integrate it with the Arduino version (just adding a different backend) and have the same subset of Python run in both versions with the same errors.

## Project #7: VisualCircuit tool, digital electronics language for robot behaviors

**Brief Explanation**: In reconfigurable circuits (FPGAs) a hardware description language is used to visually specify the circuit configuration and its behavior. For instance, the open source [IceStudio tool](https://github.com/FPGAwars/icestudio) uses such visual language to configure FPGAs. The idea of this project is to explore the use of the same visual language to program reactive robot behaviors. There are *blocks* (existing circuits) and wires to connect their inputs and outputs. Instead of synthesizing the visual program into a FPGA implementation the goal is to synthesize it into a Python program. Each block is translated into a thread that runs a transforming function at fast iterations. Each iteration reads the block inputs, does some specific processing to compute the right values and writes them on its outputs. Each wire is translated into a shared variable where the blocks can write or read.

- **Expected results:** a new tool to program reactive robot behaviors using a visual language based on blocks and wires.
- **Knowledge Prerequisite:** Python programming skills.

## Project #8: Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving with Gazebo and OpenAI gym 

**Brief Explanation**: ROS 2 is a complete rewrite of the original ROS robotic middleware, and addresses some major bottlenecks in ROS 1 leading to a major architecture change. Since ROS is a publish-subscribe middleware system at it's core, it is now built on DDS (Data Distrubution Service), which is an end to end middleware to make ROS 2 more robust. The objective of this project is to port some useful drivers from ROS 1 to ROS 2 and to improve existing tools in JdeRobot (like teleopeators and visualization tools, VisualStates...) so they can work with ROS-2 drivers. Feel free to see the current implementation of some drivers at [ROS-2 JdeRobot's Github Repository](https://github.com/JdeRobot/ros2-drivers)

# How to increase your chances of being selected in GSoC-2020

If you put yourself in the shoes of the mentor that should select the student, you'll immediately realize that there are some behaviors that are usually rewarded. Here's some examples. 

1. **Be proactive**: Mentors are more likely to select students that openly discuss the existing ideas and / or propose their own. It is a **bad idea** to just submit your idea only in the Google web site without discussing it, because it won't be noticed. 

2. **Demonstrate your skills**: Consider that mentors are being contacted by several students that apply for the same project. A way to show that you are the best candidate, is to demonstrate that you are familiar with the software and you can code. How? Browse the bug tracker (issues in github of JdeRobot project), fix some bugs and propose your patch submitting your PullRequest, and/or ask mentors to challenge you! Moreover, bug fixes are a great way to get familiar with the code. 

3. **Demonstrate your intention to stay**: Students that are likely to disappear after GSoC are less likely to be selected. This is because there is no point in developing something that won't be maintained. And moreover, one scope of GSoC is to bring new developers to the community.
