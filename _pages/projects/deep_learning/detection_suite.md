DetectionSuite is a C++ on-development tool to test and train different **DeepLearning architectures for object detection** on images. It accepts several known international datasets like PASCALVOC and allows the comparison of several DeepLearning architectures over exactly the same test data. It computes several objective statistics and measures their performance. Currently it support YOLO architectures on Darknet framework.

This is a tool for DeepLearning applications. Its development has its own public repository

- It accepts several image databases
- It allows fast annotation of object detection databases
- It shows statistics of neural network performance over images from several detection databases
- It may run networks from several DeepLearning middlware (YOLO...)
