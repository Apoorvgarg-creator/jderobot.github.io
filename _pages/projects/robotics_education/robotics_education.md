[RoboticsAcademy](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/) is an **open source** collection of exercises to learn robotics in a practical way. Gazebo simulator is the main tool required, as ROS. The students program their solutions in **Python language**. Each exercise is composed of :

1. Gazebo configuration files,
2. A ROS node that hosts the student's code,
3. A file with instructions, hints, etc..
4. The student solution itself.


1, 2, and 3 are already provided, the student has to develop her code on a separate file which already has a **template**. The student may use there an existing simple Python API to access to sensor readings and actuator `commands_` (HAL API) and she may use an existing simple Python API for Graphical User Interface and `debugging_` (GUI API). To develop her solution the student has to edit that template file and add her code, using her favorite text editor.
